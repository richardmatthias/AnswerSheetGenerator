Program Description:
This is a java tool to automatically transform a latex source file containing a problem set to an answer sheet ready to use corresponding with each question. 
This tool is specifically designed for courses like CSE20, CSE21 and CSE105 from UC San Diego, but other courses/schools with a similar format of providing questions may work as well.

Known issues:
1. This does not work if the professor used something like cont. to separate a single question on two pages.
2. This does not work if the professor used itemize for a non-question reference.
3. This does not work properly if the professor have multiple-layered sub-questions. I'm working on solving this issue asap.
